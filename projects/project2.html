            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p><dfn>Chess</dfn> is a strategic two-player board game where each player controls 16 pieces with the goal of checkmating the opponent's king.</p>
            <h3>Why make this project?</h3>
            <p>Chess is a game that even the computer or AI cannot manage to master as there is an infinite number of possibilities 
                to play. The project provides grounds to allow players to explore different moves and strategies. A chess game 
                contains various strategies and methods to play. While the movements of the pieces may seem simple, the combinations of 
                movements that occur tell a story that the project can help show as well. The movements may reveal vulnerabilities in 
                the way we think or the strengths in the way we implement the strategies. Chess allows us to reveal how we think and 
                that is why making a way to implement the game of chess allows us to show the love for the nature of the game.</p>
