            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>In simple terms a <dfn>Website Portfolio</dfn> refers to a website that showcases a person's skills, work, and experience.</p>
            <h3>Why make this project?</h3>
            <p> I created my website portfolio because building and developing have been lifelong passions of mine. While hosting projects on GitHub 
                is valuable, it often fails to capture the full depth of my experiences—the challenges I’ve tackled, the creative problem-solving involved, 
                and the lessons learned along the way. A portfolio allows me to present my work in a way that goes beyond just lines of code; it 
                tells the story behind each project.
                <br>
                Beyond showcasing my technical expertise, my portfolio is also a reflection of my diverse skill set. It highlights not only my software development 
                abilities but also my artistic and creative pursuits. From hardware implementations to intricate 3D models crafted in digital design software, this 
                space serves as a testament to my ability to merge logic with artistry. It provides a more holistic view of what I bring to the table—whether in 
                a professional setting or in the pursuit of innovative, boundary-pushing projects.</p>
